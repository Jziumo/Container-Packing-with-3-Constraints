# ISE 536 Term Project

## Part a

You are a data scientist for an independent distribution center that receives orders from a variety of companies where products range anywhere from cosmetics to sports memorabilia. Every day the warehouse receives approximately 500 orders that must be shipped to distributors within their network. The orders must fit on a 53’ freight container that will travel intermodally to a central hub and then to other warehouses within the network. In order to keep your costs to a minimum your company would like to minimize the number of 53’ containers sent per day. The containers have a weight capacity of 45,000lbs, volume capacity of 3,600in$^3$ , and can hold a total of 60 pallets double stacked. Given the orders provided in the dataset, design a solution that provides the optimal number of containers to be shipped per day. 

## Part b

The distribution company has a new strategic initiative to shorten transportation time that would ultimately get products to customers more quickly and allow them to be more competitive. Also, recently the number of orders has increased to 1,000 per day.  As the lead data scientist for the company you are tasked with developing an algorithm that minimizes the number of containers shipped per day and compute time such that the warehouse team can obtain the solution and send containers more rapidly.  Design a solution that does both: minimizes compute time and the number of containers while meeting weight, volume, and pallet constraints.
